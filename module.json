    "description": "<p>Easily browse and filter spells, feats, items, and npcs loaded from compendia!</p><strong>NEW! Compendium Browser is faster and better-behaved;</strong> it no longer loads all the compendia into memory on start-up (which sometimes hung servers because of memory or CPU requirements). Instead, it filters and loads on-demand, as well as giving you a Module Setting to control how many rows are loaded at a time.<br>Changes in v0.4.5:<ul><li>Fixed: Spells from non-system compendium show up in items tab.(<a href='https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/compendium-browser/issues/10'>Issue #10</a>)</li><li>Added: Show compendium source in results (<a href='https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/compendium-browser/issues/11'>Issue #11</a>)</li></ul>",
